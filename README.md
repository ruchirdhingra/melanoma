## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
- It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- Our end goal is to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.

## Conclusions
- When we build a simple model there is a huge diffrence between the Training and Testing Accuracy which clearly a sign of Overfitting.
- There is class imbalance is present in the dataset.
- After Augmantation the diffrence between the Training and testing accuarcy is dicreased but the accuracy is very low and the diffrence is still little high so model is not performing well.
